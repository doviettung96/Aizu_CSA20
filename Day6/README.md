This is not an assignment. You can get the exercises files from either:

1. envfs1.u-aizu.ac.jp (go to /home/csc09/day6)

2. from the course pages (go to the folder Exercises and find day6_exercises.tgz)

What you can do:

1. There are two folders named ArithmeticOperations and LoopCarriedDependencies

2. There is a folder named C under each of the above folders.

3. Compile and link the code without producing error messages. For this you need to correctly figure the dependencies of the main code, viz.,

- ArithmeticOperations/C/arithmetic_operations.c and

- LoopCarriedDependencies/C/loop_carried_dependencies.c

and compile the main program with its dependencies correctly.

4. You also need to figure out how to provide input to the executable. For this, you need to scan through the code and see how it handles input.
